# My First Spaghetti Adventure with Riverpod and Supabase

Welcome to my learning journey, where spaghetti code meets Riverpod, Supabase, and pure developer chaos! This project was my first dive into building an app with some amazing features and, naturally, a lot of "Oh, that's how you don't do it!" moments. 🍝

## Introduction
This app marks the phase of my life where I boldly ventured into the world of Riverpod for state management and Supabase for backend magic. While the code might resemble a plate of spaghetti, it's a testimony to how fun and enlightening learning can be.

> **Disclaimer:** The code is a mix of "What was I thinking?" and "Whoa, that actually works!" moments. Enjoy at your own risk. 😅

Also, fun facts:
1. I completely misunderstood how databases work at first. I treated Supabase, a structured SQL database, like it was some sort of NoSQL playground. Turns out, SQL doesn't appreciate being ignored—lesson learned! 😂
2. Instead of securely storing database credentials in an `.env` file, I went full "beginner mode" and hardcoded them right into the app files. Future me cringes every time I think about it. 😅
3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)? What even is that? I never met this person in my life. Why not copy-paste the same code all over the place and grow a massive codebase of identical lines? Turns out, maintaining that is not as fun as it sounds. 😆

## Acknowledgments
- Shoutout to Riverpod and Supabase for being awesome tools.
- Thanks to my patience (and caffeine) for enduring hours of debugging spaghetti code.
- A big thank you to SQL tutorials for rescuing me after I tried to treat Supabase like a NoSQL database. Who knew relational databases like relations?
- Apologies to the `.env` file for not using it properly at the start. I promise to do better next time.
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)? Nah, I went full WET (Write Everything Twice) mode. Copy-pasting was my mantra until I realized that debugging 10 places for the same issue is a nightmare.
- To my future self: "You've come a long way since this project. Be proud."

Feel free to explore, laugh, and perhaps shed a tear over the beauty of learning. 😄 Happy coding!
