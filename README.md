# My First Spaghetti Adventure with Riverpod and Supabase

Welcome to my learning journey, where spaghetti code meets Riverpod, Supabase, and pure developer chaos! This project was my first dive into building an app with some amazing features and, naturally, a lot of "Oh, that's how you don't do it!" moments. 🍝

## Introduction
This app marks the phase of my life where I boldly ventured into the world of Riverpod for state management and Supabase for backend magic. While the code might resemble a plate of spaghetti, it's a testimony to how fun and enlightening learning can be.

> **Disclaimer:** The code is a mix of "What was I thinking?" and "Whoa, that actually works!" moments. Enjoy at your own risk. 😅

Also, fun fact: I completely misunderstood how databases work at first. I treated Supabase, a structured SQL database, like it was some sort of NoSQL playground. Turns out, SQL doesn't appreciate being ignored—lesson learned! 😂

## Acknowledgments
- Shoutout to Riverpod and Supabase for being awesome tools.
- Thanks to my patience (and caffeine) for enduring hours of debugging spaghetti code.
- A big thank you to SQL tutorials for rescuing me after I tried to treat Supabase like a NoSQL database. Who knew relational databases like relations?
- To my future self: "You've come a long way since this project. Be proud."

Feel free to explore, laugh, and perhaps shed a tear over the beauty of learning. 😄 Happy coding!
